## MySQL bootcamp Capstone Project

### Project title: Instagram Database Clone

#### Introduction 

This Instagram database clone capstone is part of the MySQL bootcamp course by colt steele on udemy. To complete the course, I had to take on the Instagram database clone challenge. The project is aimed to showcase the skills acquired throughout the course, providing a practical demonstration of SQL database management and web application development.


#### Problem-statement 

Instagram, as one of the most popular social media platforms, serves as the inspiration for this project. The Instagram Clone Capstone Project replicates core functionalities of the platform, allowing users to register, share photos, engage through comments and likes, explore content through hashtags, and connect with others by following fellow users.

Through this project, we delve into the intricacies of database design, manipulation, and optimization, utilizing MySQL to structure and manage our relational database. By implementing robust SQL queries, we ensure efficient data retrieval, modification, and storage, providing a seamless user experience.


### Populating the Database:

To ensure a fully functional Instagram clone experience, our project involves populating the database tables with initial data. This includes creating sample user profiles, uploading photos, generating comments and likes, and establishing follower/followee relationships. The 6 tables are:

1. USERS
2. PHOTOS
3. COMMENTS
4. HASHTAGS
5. LIKES
6. FOLOWERS/FOLLOWEES

To achieve this, we will employ a combination of manual data entry and automated scripts. Initially, we will manually insert seed data for a few user profiles, each with associated photos, comments, likes, and followers/followees. This manual approach allows us to tailor the initial dataset to showcase a diverse range of interactions within the platform.
